# nasebohr

**This project has been archived.** There are various other projects providing CLI DNS clients with nice output. Most of them were started around when I started this project, but they still are actively maintained and support many more features than what nasebohr does: [dog](https://dns.lookup.dog/), [doggo](https://github.com/mr-karan/doggo), [q](https://github.com/natesales/q).

A command-line tool for DNS queries, with colors and beautiful output

## FAQ

### What does the name mean?

The German "nasebohr" literally means "nose-bore", but loosely translates to
"picking one's nose". Given that existing DNS client utilities are named
[dig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_(command)) and
[drill](https://linux.die.net/man/1/drill), "bohr" seems like a logical
evolution. Given that we're looking at **na**me **se**rvers, the "nase" is more
than fitting as well.
